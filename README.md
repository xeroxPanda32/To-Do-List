# First Assignment - To-Do List

## Overview

This project is a To-Do list.

### Key Functionalities

- Each item has Title, description, and End date.
- User can set the priority of the List.
- User can sort the list based on priority and end date.
- User can add a new item to the list, delete or edit the list, and change the status to completed.
- The lists have three categories:
  1. the to-do list.
  2. the list of doing.
  3. the list of tasks done.

## How to Use

1. Open the `.html` file in a browser.
2. Click on the "Add" button (a form will appear to add the task to the list).
3. Add the title, description, and end date of the task, choose the priority, and the status of the task as suited.
4. Sort the list based on Priority and End-Date.
5. In each list, the status of the task can be changed.
6. The list will be displayed under the heading of the chosen status.
7. Edit a task by clicking on the "Edit" button (a form will appear for editing).
8. After editing, click on "Update" for the task to be saved.
9. When a task is completed, the user can change the status to "completed".

## Improvements
- Would have been comparitively simpler if I had used ReactJS.
   - Would have been simpler as in React we make components which be resued.
   - we would not be required to create div and other HTML elements manually.
   - Easier to handle the flow of program
   - Easier to create event Handlers.
- Styling would be more easier to do by using TailwindCSS
  - Easier to implement styling as predefined classes are present.
- By using these the code would have been much cleaner and easier to read.
